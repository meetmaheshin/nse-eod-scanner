    Collecting yfinance>=0.2.0
    ...
==> Build successful 🎉
==> Starting service with 'cd web_views && gunicorn...'
==> Your service is live 🎉
```

**This takes 5-10 minutes.** ☕ Be patient!

---

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS!

When you see:
```
==> Your service is live 🎉
```

### Your URL will be at the top:
```
https://nse-scanner.onrender.com
```

Or something like:
```
https://nse-scanner-abc123.onrender.com
```

---

## 🎯 TEST YOUR SCANNER

1. **Click the URL** or copy it to browser
2. You should see your **Live Scanner** with NIFTY 50 stocks! 📊
3. **Test from phone:** Open same URL on mobile browser 📱
4. **Share with friends:** Send them the URL! 🌍

---

## 🔄 VIEWS AVAILABLE

Your deployment shows the **Live View** (Port 5000 locally).

To access different views on Render.com:
- **Combined View:** `https://your-app.onrender.com/`
- **Long Signals:** `https://your-app.onrender.com/long`
- **Short Signals:** `https://your-app.onrender.com/short`

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Free Tier Behavior:
- ⏰ **Service sleeps** after 15 minutes of no traffic
- ⏳ **First request** after sleep takes 30-60 seconds (server wakes up)
- ✅ Then it's fast again!
- 📊 **750 hours/month** free (more than enough)

### Data Updates:
The scanner on Render.com will show the **CSV data you pushed to GitHub**.

**To update with new data:**
1. Run scanner locally: `eod_scanner_nse_improved.py`
2. New CSV files generated
3. Push to GitHub:
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated scanner data"
   git push
   ```
4. Render.com **auto-deploys** (if auto-deploy is on)

---

## 🚀 WHAT'S NEXT?

### Option 1: Set Up Daily Scanner Automation
Run scanner automatically at 3:35 PM daily:
- **Guide:** `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` → Auto-Run Scanner
- **Tool:** Windows Task Scheduler
- **Time:** 15 minutes setup

### Option 2: Deploy Prediction View Too
Currently only Live View is deployed. To deploy predictions:
1. Create another web service on Render.com
2. Same settings but change Start Command to:
   ```
   cd web_views && gunicorn prediction_view_simple:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 2 --timeout 120
   ```

### Option 3: Upgrade for Better Performance
- **Free tier:** Sleeps after 15 min
- **Paid tier ($7/month):** Always awake, faster, more resources

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Build Failed?
Check the build log for errors. Common fixes:
- Make sure `requirements.txt` is correct ✅ (it is!)
- Check Start Command is exact ✅ (use the one above)

### "Application failed to respond"?
- Check Start Command includes: `--bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- Make sure it's `gunicorn live_view_new:app` (not just `live_view_new.py`)

### Can't see latest data?
- CSV files need to be pushed to GitHub first
- Then Render redeploys automatically
