## What is the "High Confidence" Tab?

The **⭐ High Confidence (60%+)** tab shows predictions where the system is **at least 60% confident** that the trade will be profitable.

## 📊 How Confidence is Calculated

### Formula:
```
Confidence = (Score × 10) + 20
```

### Examples:
| Score | Confidence | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 8 | 100% | 🟢 Very High - Strongest signal |
| 7 | 90% | 🟢 Very High |
| 6 | 80% | 🟢 High |
| 5 | 70% | 🟢 Good |
| 4 | 60% | 🟠 Above Average |
| 3 | 50% | 🟠 Average |
| 2 | 40% | 🔴 Below Average |
| 1 | 30% | 🔴 Low |
| 0 | 20% | 🔴 Very Low |

### High Confidence Threshold:
- **60%+** = Shows in High Confidence tab
